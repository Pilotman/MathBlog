<p>For this post, I want to explore a property of the natural numbers (or integers in this case) that is taught at a very young age and whose proof relies on a weird quirk of the decimal system.</p>

<h2 id="the-rule-of-threes">The rule of threes</h2>

<p>Assume that we have a very large number, like <script type="math/tex">543</script>, and we want to know whether this number is divisible by 3, that is, than when we divide it by three, the remainder is 0:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">543 = 3\cdot k,\qquad\text{for some }k\in\mathbb{Z}</script>

<p>An easy way of checking would be to just divide it and see, but, what if that was a lot harder? The rule of threes could help, it tells us that: <em>a number is divisible by three if and only if the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by three</em>. So we check:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">5+4+3 = 12</script>

<p>Which is divisible by three! (We could keep going as <script type="math/tex">1+2=3</script>)</p>

<p>With nine the same rule applies, but why does it work?</p>

<p>First, let us get some Mathematics out of the way:</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>In algebra, we call a set with a sum and a multiplication a <strong>Ring</strong> if those operations have certain properties, we won’t go into a lot of detail, but the basic properties are (we will assume that we are in a commutative ring to ease some complication, this means that <script type="math/tex">a\cdot b = b\cdot a</script>), let <script type="math/tex">R</script> be a ring:</p>
<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">R</script> is closed by addition, this means that, if we have two elements in <script type="math/tex">R</script>, then their sum will also be in <script type="math/tex">R</script>. Addition also has the following properties:
    <ol>
      <li>It is associative: <script type="math/tex">a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c</script></li>
      <li>It is commutative: <script type="math/tex">a + b = b + a</script></li>
      <li>There is an element called zero (0) which acts as an identity for the sum, that is <script type="math/tex">0+a=a</script></li>
      <li>For every element <script type="math/tex">a</script> in <script type="math/tex">R</script> there is an <em>additive inverse</em> called <script type="math/tex">-a</script>, such that <script type="math/tex">a + (-a) = 0</script>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">R</script> is closed by multiplication, this means that, if we have two elements in <script type="math/tex">R</script>, then their product will also be in <script type="math/tex">R</script>. Multiplication also has the following properties:
    <ol>
      <li><em>Commutative</em>. As we stated in the definition, this is not part of the usual definition of ring, but, because we <strong>do not</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> want to deal with non-commutative rings right now, we will assume that the product is commutative.</li>
      <li>It is associative: <script type="math/tex">a\cdot (b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c</script></li>
      <li>There is an element called one (1) which acts as an identity for the multiplication, that is <script type="math/tex">1\cdot a = a</script></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Both are associative: <script type="math/tex">a(b + c) = ab + ac</script></li>
</ul>

<p>You might think “<em>Hang on, every set of numbers I know follows this!</em>”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, you are right for the most part. This is why we use this in Algebra.</p>

<p>Say, we have the set of all the integers, usually written as <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}</script>, this is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{Z}=
\lbrace
\cdots, -4,-3,-2,-1,
0,
1,2,3,4,\cdots
\rbrace</script>

<p>what if we wanted to multiply all the elements by, say, three? We wolud write that as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">3\mathbb{Z} = 
\lbrace
\cdots, -12,-9,-6,-3,
0,
3,6,9,12,\cdots
\rbrace</script>

<p>And now, what if we want to get only the <strong>possible remainders of dividing by three</strong>? This is what is called a modular ring, it is defined via a relation we will see in a sec, for now:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{Z}_3 = \mathbb{Z}/{3\mathbb{Z}} = \lbrace
\bar{0}, \bar{1}, \bar{2}
\rbrace</script>

<p>The bar notation will come in handy in a second.</p>

<p>It is clear that the only possible remainders when dividing by three are 0, 1 and 2. We determine which one is the remainder of a number using <em>Euclid’s Algorithm</em> for division, also called <em>Long Division</em>, which gives us, for any integer <script type="math/tex">m</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">m = 3\cdot k + r</script>

<p>Where <script type="math/tex">k</script> is the number we find through division, and <script type="math/tex">r</script> our remainder. The ring above, what it does, is “<em>squash</em>” every element in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}</script> into its <em>modular class</em>, or, the remainder they give out when dividing by three, usually written with the bar, then <script type="math/tex">\bar{2}</script> would represent any number that gives a remainder of two when dividing by three.</p>

<p>This is what is called a “cyclic” ring, because it is clear that when you add <script type="math/tex">\bar{2}+\bar{1}=\bar{0}</script>, why? Because adding up numbers with a modulo of 2 (remainder of two) and numbers with a modulo of 1 always will give out a multiple of three.</p>

<p>This ring is closed and it has many more nice properties (because 3 is prime) but, why is this so interesting? Because we have a way to embed our numbers here, this is called the modulo operation and it has a very cumbersome notation:</p>

<p>We will say that <script type="math/tex">x \equiv 2 \mod 3</script> or <script type="math/tex">x\equiv \bar{2}</script><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> if the remainder when dividing by 3 is 2. This operation, as it is defined, has the nice property of being able to be taken through parentheses, as we saw, due to the cyclical nature of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}_3</script>, this means, and bear with the horrendous notation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(a+b)\mod 3 = \left[ 
a \mod 3 + b \mod 3
\right]\mod 3</script>

<p>Which is the reason I prefer using the bars and pretending that everything is happening inside of a modular ring.</p>

<p>Now, back to the rule of threes:</p>

<h2 id="a-proof-of-the-rule-of-threes">A proof of the rule of threes</h2>

<p>Imagine we are given a number <script type="math/tex">x</script> in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}</script>, this number will have a set of digits in decimal, we will refer to these digits as <script type="math/tex">x_n,\dots,x_2,x_1,x_0</script> such that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = x_n10^n + \cdots + x_1 10 + x_010^0</script>

<p>(remember that <script type="math/tex">10^0 = 0</script>)</p>

<p>Now, we want to prove that, if <script type="math/tex">x</script> is divisible by 3, that is, if <script type="math/tex">x\equiv 0\mod 3</script> or <script type="math/tex">x\equiv\bar{0}</script>, the sum of all its digits is as well.</p>

<p>We begin by taking the modulo of <script type="math/tex">x</script>, we will assume <script type="math/tex">x</script> is divisible by three to prove the statement:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
x \equiv 0\mod 3 \Rightarrow x \mod 3\equiv 0 \Rightarrow (x_n10^n + \cdots + x_1 10 + x_010^0) \mod 3 &\equiv& 0 \\
(x_n10^n\mod 3) + \cdots + (x_1 10\mod 3) + (x_010^0\mod 3) &\equiv& 0
\end{eqnarray} %]]></script>

<p>Now, we can also take the modulo through the products, and, we will do a change of notation and move to <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}_3</script>, here, because it is a ring:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\overline{x_n10^n}=\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{10^n}</script>

<p>Now, we rewrite the equation above:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{10^n} 
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot\overline{10^1} + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}</script>

<p>Now, it is very easy to see that all the powers of ten will be equivalent to 1 modulo 3:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{eqnarray}
10 = 3\cdot 3 + 1\therefore \overline{10}&\equiv&\bar{1}\\
\overline{10^2} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10}&\equiv&
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\
\overline{10^3} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10^2}&\equiv&
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\
&\vdots&\\
\overline{10^n} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10^{n-1}}&\equiv&
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\

\end{eqnarray} %]]></script>

<p>Now, we can rewrite the equation above yet again:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{1} 
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot\overline{1} + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}</script>

<p>And, because of the asociative property, we will have:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\overline{x_n}\cdot
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}</script>

<p>And now, we have two things, and their product is 0, because <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}_3</script> <em>behaves properly</em> (read: does not have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_divisor">zero divisors</a>), we will have to assume that, either $$(\overline{x_n}\cdot</p>
<ul>
  <li>\cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\equiv 0<script type="math/tex">or</script>\bar{1}\equiv\bar{0}$$ and the second one is impossible, so we have that:</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\overline{x_n}\cdot
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\equiv 0</script>

<p>Which means that the sum of the digits is divisible by three</p>

<p>$$\hspace{25cm}\blacksquare</p>
