<p>For this post, I want to explore a property of the natural numbers (or integers in this case) that is taught at a very young age and whose proof relies on a weird quirk of the decimal system.</p>

<h2 id="the-rule-of-threes">The rule of threes</h2>

<p>Assume that we have a very large number, like \(543\), and we want to know whether this number is divisible by 3, that is, than when we divide it by three, the remainder is 0:</p>

\[543 = 3\cdot k,\qquad\text{for some }k\in\mathbb{Z}\]

<p>An easy way of checking would be to just divide it and see, but, what if that was a lot harder? The rule of threes could help, it tells us that: <em>a number is divisible by three if and only if the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by three</em>. So we check:</p>

\[5+4+3 = 12\]

<p>Which is divisible by three! (We could keep going as \(1+2=3\))</p>

<p>With nine the same rule applies, but why does it work?</p>

<p>First, let us get some Mathematics out of the way:</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>In algebra, we call a set with a sum and a multiplication a <strong>Ring</strong> if those operations have certain properties, we won‚Äôt go into a lot of detail, but the basic properties are (we will assume that we are in a commutative ring to ease some complication, this means that \(a\cdot b = b\cdot a\)), let \(R\) be a ring:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(R\) is closed by addition, this means that, if we have two elements in \(R\), then their sum will also be in \(R\). Addition also has the following properties:
    <ol>
      <li>It is associative: \(a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c\)</li>
      <li>It is commutative: \(a + b = b + a\)</li>
      <li>There is an element called zero (0) which acts as an identity for the sum, that is \(0+a=a\)</li>
      <li>For every element \(a\) in \(R\) there is an <em>additive inverse</em> called \(-a\), such that \(a + (-a) = 0\).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>\(R\) is closed by multiplication, this means that, if we have two elements in \(R\), then their product will also be in \(R\). Multiplication also has the following properties:
    <ol>
      <li><em>Commutative</em>. As we stated in the definition, this is not part of the usual definition of ring, but, because we <strong>do not</strong><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> want to deal with non-commutative rings right now, we will assume that the product is commutative.</li>
      <li>It is associative: \(a\cdot (b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c\)</li>
      <li>There is an element called one (1) which acts as an identity for the multiplication, that is \(1\cdot a = a\)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Both are associative: \(a(b + c) = ab + ac\)</li>
</ul>

<p>You might think ‚Äú<em>Hang on, every set of numbers I know follows this!</em>‚Äù<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, you are right for the most part. This is why we use this in Algebra.</p>

<p>Say, we have the set of all the integers, usually written as \(\mathbb{Z}\), this is:</p>

\[\mathbb{Z}=
\lbrace
\cdots, -4,-3,-2,-1,
0,
1,2,3,4,\cdots
\rbrace\]

<p>what if we wanted to multiply all the elements by, say, three? We wolud write that as:</p>

\[3\mathbb{Z} = 
\lbrace
\cdots, -12,-9,-6,-3,
0,
3,6,9,12,\cdots
\rbrace\]

<p>And now, what if we want to get only the <strong>possible remainders of dividing by three</strong>? This is what is called a modular ring, it is defined via a relation we will see in a sec, for now:</p>

\[\mathbb{Z}_3 = \mathbb{Z}/{3\mathbb{Z}} = \lbrace
\bar{0}, \bar{1}, \bar{2}
\rbrace\]

<p>The bar notation will come in handy in a second.</p>

<p>It is clear that the only possible remainders when dividing by three are 0, 1 and 2. We determine which one is the remainder of a number using <em>Euclid‚Äôs Algorithm</em> for division, also called <em>Long Division</em>, which gives us, for any integer \(m\):</p>

\[m = 3\cdot k + r\]

<p>Where \(k\) is the number we find through division, and \(r\) our remainder. The ring above, what it does, is ‚Äú<em>squash</em>‚Äù every element in \(\mathbb{Z}\) into its <em>modular class</em>, or, the remainder they give out when dividing by three, usually written with the bar, then \(\bar{2}\) would represent any number that gives a remainder of two when dividing by three.</p>

<p>This is what is called a ‚Äúcyclic‚Äù ring, because it is clear that when you add \(\bar{2}+\bar{1}=\bar{0}\), why? Because adding up numbers with a modulo of 2 (remainder of two) and numbers with a modulo of 1 always will give out a multiple of three.</p>

<p>This ring is closed and it has many more nice properties (because 3 is prime) but, why is this so interesting? Because we have a way to embed our numbers here, this is called the modulo operation and it has a very cumbersome notation:</p>

<p>We will say that \(x \equiv 2 \mod 3\) or \(x\equiv \bar{2}\)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> if the remainder when dividing by 3 is 2. This operation, as it is defined, has the nice property of being able to be taken through parentheses, as we saw, due to the cyclical nature of \(\mathbb{Z}_3\), this means, and bear with the horrendous notation:</p>

\[(a+b)\mod 3 = \left[ 
a \mod 3 + b \mod 3
\right]\mod 3\]

<p>Which is the reason I prefer using the bars and pretending that everything is happening inside of a modular ring.</p>

<p>Now, back to the rule of threes:</p>

<h2 id="a-proof-of-the-rule-of-threes">A proof of the rule of threes</h2>

<p>Imagine we are given a number \(x\) in \(\mathbb{Z}\), this number will have a set of digits in decimal, we will refer to these digits as \(x_n,\dots,x_2,x_1,x_0\) such that:</p>

\[x = x_n10^n + \cdots + x_1 10 + x_010^0\]

<p>(remember that \(10^0 = 0\))</p>

<p>Now, we want to prove that, if \(x\) is divisible by 3, that is, if \(x\equiv 0\mod 3\) or \(x\equiv\bar{0}\), the sum of all its digits is as well.</p>

<p>We begin by taking the modulo of \(x\), we will assume \(x\) is divisible by three to prove the statement:</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
x \equiv 0\mod 3 \Rightarrow x \mod 3\equiv 0 \Rightarrow (x_n10^n + \cdots + x_1 10 + x_010^0) \mod 3 &amp;\equiv&amp; 0 \\
(x_n10^n\mod 3) + \cdots + (x_1 10\mod 3) + (x_010^0\mod 3) &amp;\equiv&amp; 0
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>Now, we can also take the modulo through the products, and, we will do a change of notation and move to \(\mathbb{Z}_3\), here, because it is a ring:</p>

\[\overline{x_n10^n}=\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{10^n}\]

<p>Now, we rewrite the equation above:</p>

\[\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{10^n} 
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot\overline{10^1} + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}\]

<p>Now, it is very easy to see that all the powers of ten will be equivalent to 1 modulo 3:</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
10 = 3\cdot 3 + 1\therefore \overline{10}&amp;\equiv&amp;\bar{1}\\
\overline{10^2} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10}&amp;\equiv&amp;
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\
\overline{10^3} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10^2}&amp;\equiv&amp;
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\
&amp;\vdots&amp;\\
\overline{10^n} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10^{n-1}}&amp;\equiv&amp;
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\

\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>Now, we can rewrite the equation above yet again:</p>

\[\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{1} 
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot\overline{1} + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}\]

<p>And, because of the asociative property, we will have:</p>

\[(\overline{x_n}\cdot
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}\]

<p>And now, we have two things, and their product is 0, because \(\mathbb{Z}_3\) <em>behaves properly</em> (read: does not have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_divisor">zero divisors</a>), we will have to assume that, either $$(\overline{x_n}\cdot</p>
<ul>
  <li>\cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\equiv 0\(or\)\bar{1}\equiv\bar{0}$$ and the second one is impossible, so we have that:</li>
</ul>

\[(\overline{x_n}\cdot
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\equiv 0\]

<p>Which means that the sum of the digits is divisible by three</p>
