<p>I just want to give two very interesting cases of series a whirl. But first, I need to introduce some context:</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>We call a set of numbers \(\lbrace a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \rbrace\) a <strong>sequence</strong>. We can say a sequence is indexed by a subset \(J\) of the natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\) if we can describe the set above as<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

\[\lbrace
 a_i \vert \text{where }i\in J
\rbrace\]

<p>And we will call \(J\) the <strong>indexing set</strong>. In the case where the number of elements in \(J\) (sometimes written \(\vert J \vert\), read <em>cardinality of \(J\)</em>) is infinite, by convention, we will write \(J = \mathbb{N}\), we can call that sequence an <strong>infinite sequence</strong>.</p>

<p>If we have a sequence \(\lbrace a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \rbrace\) with an indexing set \(J\), we sometimes write the sequence as:</p>

\[\lbrace
 a_i
\rbrace_{i\in J}\]

<p>and this way we can write both the sequence elements and the indexing set in one go.</p>

<p>We call a set <strong>countably infinite</strong> if there is a possible one-to-one mapping from it to the natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\). We call it <strong>uncountably infinite</strong>, or for a much nicer name, we say that <strong>it has the cardinality of the continuum</strong> if there is no such mapping.</p>

<p>We can sum all the elements in a sequence, we will write this sum as:</p>

\[\sum_{i\in J} a_i\]

<p>in a general sense, but there are two other cases, if \(J\) is a sequence of natural numbers from 1 to \(n\), we can write:</p>

\[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\]

<p>or, if \(J= \mathbb{N}\):</p>

\[\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i\]

<p>and yes, 0 is <strong>not</strong> a natural number. When \(J\) is countably infinite, we call this a <strong>series</strong></p>

<h2 id="types-of-series">Types of series</h2>

<p>Basically, we can either have a series that will sum up to \(\infty\) or one that sums up to a finite amount (we can also have one type that just oscilates back and forth, but that‚Äôs not important now).</p>

<p>We will call the first type <strong>divergent</strong> and the second type <strong>convergent</strong>.</p>

<p>Now the two interesting examples:</p>

<h3 id="the-geometric-series">The Geometric Series</h3>
<p>Most people have seen this one, but I like the proof, specially, using it to remember the formula.</p>

<p>We define recursively a geometric series as (indexing starting at 0, so \(J = \mathbb{N}\cup\lbrace 0 \rbrace\), where \(\cup\) means ‚Äú<em>joined</em>‚Äù):</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
 a_0 &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
 a_{i+1} &amp;=&amp; a_i\cdot r
\end{eqnarray}
\qquad\text{where }r\text{ is a real constant called ratio}\]

<p>If \(r\ge 1\), we can check quickly that the sum cannot converge, as the values keep getting bigger, or, better put:\(\begin{eqnarray}
 a_0 &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
 a_{i+1} &amp;=&amp; a_i\cdot r
\end{eqnarray}
\qquad\text{where }r\text{ is a real constant}\)</p>

\[\lim_{i\to\infty} a_i =\infty\]

<p>But, if we have \(r&lt;1\) we have a chance that it is convergent:</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
 S = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i &amp;=&amp; 1 + r + r^2 + \cdots\\
                        rS &amp;=&amp;\quad\ \  r + r^2 + \cdots
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>Now we can substract \(S - rS\) and that way we get:</p>

\[S-rS = 1\Rightarrow (1-r)S=1\Rightarrow S={1\over (1-r)}\]

\[\hspace{25cm}\blacksquare\]

<p>If we want a more general Geometric Series:</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
 a_0 &amp;=&amp; A \\
 a_{i+1} &amp;=&amp; a_i\cdot r
\end{eqnarray}
\qquad\text{where }r\text{ is a real constant}\]

<p>we can see quickly that:</p>

\[A + Ar + Ar^2 + \cdots = A(1+r+r^2+\cdots) = AS = {A \over (1-r)}\]

<p>Now the true interesting one:</p>

<h3 id="the-harmonic-series">The Harmonic series</h3>

<p>We saw before that we checked whether the sequence ‚Äúwent to zero‚Äù before checking the series. We need this property, if we do not have it, the series <strong>cannot</strong> converge, this is why the geometric series, with ratio \(r\ge 1\) could not converge.</p>

<p>It seems intuitive that that would also go the other way, so to say, that if we <strong>do have</strong> the property, the series converges, but this is not the case, and what better way to prove this than a counterexample:</p>

<p>The harmonic series is simply defined as:</p>

\[\lbrace
 a_i
\rbrace_{i\in \mathbb{N}}\qquad\text{where }
a_i = {1\over i}\]

<p>And, it would make sense for it to converge, right?<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> To see that it does not, we will check if we can find a ‚Äú<em>smaller</em>‚Äù series that does not converge either:</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
 1 + {1\over2} + {1\over3} + {1\over4} + {1\over5} +{1\over6}+{1\over7}+{1\over8}+{1\over9}+{1\over10}+ \cdots \ge\\
 1 + {1\over2} + {1\over4} + {1\over4} + {1\over8} +{1\over8}+{1\over8}+{1\over8}+{1\over16}+{1\over116}+ \cdots
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>We have substituted every element whose denominator is not a multiple of two by the closest multiple of two above it:</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
 &amp;1&amp; + {1\over2} + {1\over4} + {1\over4} + {1\over8} +{1\over8}+{1\over8}+{1\over8}+{1\over16}+{1\over16}+ \cdots = \\
 &amp;=&amp; (1) + 
 \left({1\over2}\right) + 
 \left({1\over4} + {1\over4}\right) +
 \left({1\over8} +{1\over8}+{1\over8}+{1\over8}\right) +
 \left({1\over16}+\cdots+{1\over16}\right)+\cdots
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>And now, each of the parenthesis sums to \(1\over2\), therefore, the above will equal:</p>

\[1 + {1\over2} +{1\over2} +{1\over2} +\cdots = \infty\]

<p>Which means:</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
 1 + {1\over2} + {1\over3} + {1\over4} + {1\over5} +{1\over6}+{1\over7}+{1\over8}+ \cdots \ge 1 + {1\over2} +{1\over2} +{1\over2} +\cdots = \infty
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>Which trivially shows that the sum goes to infinity (because it is ‚Äú<em>greater than infinity</em>‚Äù)</p>
