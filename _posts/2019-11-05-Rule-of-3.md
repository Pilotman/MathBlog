For this post, I want to explore a property of the natural numbers (or integers in this case) that is taught at a very young age and whose proof relies on a weird quirk of the decimal system.

## The rule of threes

Assume that we have a very large number, like $$543$$, and we want to know whether this number is divisible by 3, that is, than when we divide it by three, the remainder is 0:

$$
543 = 3\cdot k,\qquad\text{for some }k\in\mathbb{Z}
$$

An easy way of checking would be to just divide it and see, but, what if that was a lot harder? The rule of threes could help, it tells us that: *a number is divisible by three if and only if the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by three*. So we check:

$$
5+4+3 = 12
$$

Which is divisible by three! (We could keep going as $$1+2=3$$)

With nine the same rule applies, but why does it work?

First, let us get some Mathematics out of the way:

## Definitions

In algebra, we call a set with a sum and a multiplication a **Ring** if those operations have certain properties, we won't go into a lot of detail, but the basic properties are (we will assume that we are in a commutative ring to ease some complication, this means that $$a\cdot b = b\cdot a$$), let $$R$$ be a ring:
- $$R$$ is closed by addition, this means that, if we have two elements in $$R$$, then their sum will also be in $$R$$. Addition also has the following properties:
  1. It is associative: $$a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c$$
  2. It is commutative: $$a + b = b + a$$
  3. There is an element called zero (0) which acts as an identity for the sum, that is $$0+a=a$$
  4. For every element $$a$$ in $$R$$ there is an *additive inverse* called $$-a$$, such that $$a + (-a) = 0$$.
- $$R$$ is closed by multiplication, this means that, if we have two elements in $$R$$, then their product will also be in $$R$$. Multiplication also has the following properties:
  1. *Commutative*. As we stated in the definition, this is not part of the usual definition of ring, but, because we **do not**[^1] want to deal with non-commutative rings right now, we will assume that the product is commutative.
  2. It is associative: $$a\cdot (b\cdot c) = (a\cdot b)\cdot c$$
  3. There is an element called one (1) which acts as an identity for the multiplication, that is $$1\cdot a = a$$
- Both are associative: $$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$

[^1]: trust me, **we do not**

You might think "*Hang on, every set of numbers I know follows this!*"[^2], you are right for the most part. This is why we use this in Algebra.

[^2]: If you are not thinking that, Hi fellow mathematician/physicist

Say, we have the set of all the integers, usually written as $$\mathbb{Z}$$, this is:

$$
\mathbb{Z}=
\lbrace
\cdots, -4,-3,-2,-1,
0,
1,2,3,4,\cdots
\rbrace
$$

what if we wanted to multiply all the elements by, say, three? We wolud write that as:

$$
3\mathbb{Z} = 
\lbrace
\cdots, -12,-9,-6,-3,
0,
3,6,9,12,\cdots
\rbrace
$$

And now, what if we want to get only the **possible remainders of dividing by three**? This is what is called a modular ring, it is defined via a relation we will see in a sec, for now:

$$
\mathbb{Z}_3 = \mathbb{Z}/{3\mathbb{Z}} = \lbrace
\bar{0}, \bar{1}, \bar{2}
\rbrace
$$

The bar notation will come in handy in a second.

It is clear that the only possible remainders when dividing by three are 0, 1 and 2. We determine which one is the remainder of a number using *Euclid's Algorithm* for division, also called *Long Division*, which gives us, for any integer $$m$$:

$$
m = 3\cdot k + r
$$

Where $$k$$ is the number we find through division, and $$r$$ our remainder. The ring above, what it does, is "*squash*" every element in $$\mathbb{Z}$$ into its *modular class*, or, the remainder they give out when dividing by three, usually written with the bar, then $$\bar{2}$$ would represent any number that gives a remainder of two when dividing by three.

This is what is called a "cyclic" ring, because it is clear that when you add $$\bar{2}+\bar{1}=\bar{0}$$, why? Because adding up numbers with a modulo of 2 (remainder of two) and numbers with a modulo of 1 always will give out a multiple of three.

This ring is closed and it has many more nice properties (because 3 is prime) but, why is this so interesting? Because we have a way to embed our numbers here, this is called the modulo operation and it has a very cumbersome notation:

We will say that $$x \equiv 2 \mod 3$$ or $$x\equiv \bar{2}$$[^3] if the remainder when dividing by 3 is 2. This operation, as it is defined, has the nice property of being able to be taken through parentheses, as we saw, due to the cyclical nature of $$\mathbb{Z}_3$$, this means, and bear with the horrendous notation:

[^3]: We use this one when we do not need to specify what number we are dividing by

$$
(a+b)\mod 3 = \left[ 
a \mod 3 + b \mod 3
\right]\mod 3
$$

Which is the reason I prefer using the bars and pretending that everything is happening inside of a modular ring.

Now, back to the rule of threes:

## A proof of the rule of threes

Imagine we are given a number $$x$$ in $$\mathbb{Z}$$, this number will have a set of digits in decimal, we will refer to these digits as $$x_n,\dots,x_2,x_1,x_0$$ such that:

$$
x = x_n10^n + \cdots + x_1 10 + x_010^0
$$

(remember that $$10^0 = 0$$)

Now, we want to prove that, if $$x$$ is divisible by 3, that is, if $$x\equiv 0\mod 3$$ or $$x\equiv\bar{0}$$, the sum of all its digits is as well.

We begin by taking the modulo of $$x$$, we will assume $$x$$ is divisible by three to prove the statement:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
x \equiv 0\mod 3 \Rightarrow x \mod 3\equiv 0 \Rightarrow (x_n10^n + \cdots + x_1 10 + x_010^0) \mod 3 &\equiv& 0 \\
(x_n10^n\mod 3) + \cdots + (x_1 10\mod 3) + (x_010^0\mod 3) &\equiv& 0
\end{eqnarray}$$

Now, we can also take the modulo through the products, and, we will do a change of notation and move to $$\mathbb{Z}_3$$, here, because it is a ring:

$$\overline{x_n10^n}=\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{10^n}$$

Now, we rewrite the equation above:

$$
\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{10^n} 
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot\overline{10^1} + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}
$$

Now, it is very easy to see that all the powers of ten will be equivalent to 1 modulo 3:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
10 = 3\cdot 3 + 1\therefore \overline{10}&\equiv&\bar{1}\\
\overline{10^2} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10}&\equiv&
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\
\overline{10^3} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10^2}&\equiv&
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\
&\vdots&\\
\overline{10^n} = \overline{10}\cdot\overline{10^{n-1}}&\equiv&
                                  \bar{1}\cdot\bar{1}=\bar{1}\\

\end{eqnarray}
$$

Now, we can rewrite the equation above yet again:

$$
\overline{x_n}\cdot\overline{1} 
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot\overline{1} + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}
$$

And, because of the asociative property, we will have:

$$
(\overline{x_n}\cdot
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\overline{1} \equiv \bar{0}
$$

And now, we have two things, and their product is 0, because $$\mathbb{Z}_3$$ *behaves properly* (read: does not have [zero divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_divisor)), we will have to assume that, either $$(\overline{x_n}\cdot
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\equiv 0$$ or $$\bar{1}\equiv\bar{0}$$ and the second one is impossible, so we have that:

$$(\overline{x_n}\cdot
+ \cdots + 
\overline{x_1}\cdot + 
\overline{x_0}\cdot)\equiv 0$$

Which means that the sum of the digits is divisible by three
