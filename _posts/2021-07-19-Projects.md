I am now working on some basic math notes aimed at Spanish Bachillerato students (Last cycle before uni) and I will upload it whenever it is slightly more advanced. I will also renew my twitter and might delete my Instagram from the side panel.

This blog was made with the idea of sharing interesting topics I came across as I studied maths, I will try to keep it up to date, especially keeping in mind that this year I'll have to present my undergrad thesis. This blog marks when I started noticing how much I enjoy algebra, so I hope I won't stop talking about that.
